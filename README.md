# vueit

View + Model-View aspect of the Trakit application.
Technologies:
* Vue 2
* Vuex
* Axios - API calls
* Vue Router

## Lessons Learned
1. Implement data model before View layer. Mucking around with CSS and JS is fun and gives instant gratification, but sucks up a lot of time, and is likely to be changed later
2. Take time to set up State Management at the beginning. Because I focused on instant gratification first, it's become a headache with no visual reward to go through and add it now.
3. Find a library to solve the problem. Don't reinvent the wheel.
